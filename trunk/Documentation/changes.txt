## Version 0.2.0
- Added support for char type on SQL Server by Luke Melia & Daniel Berlinger
- Fix some issues with SQL Server 2005 pointed out by Luke Melia & Daniel Berlinger
- Added migrate NAnt task
- Added basic schema dumper functionnality for MySql.
- Restructured project tree
- Applied patch from Tanner Burson to fix first run problem with SchemaInfo table creation

## Version 0.1.0
- Renamed "RemoveConstraint" to "RemoveForeignKey". We need to add Unique constraint support, but it's not in here yet.
- Merged most of the provider unit test code to a base class.
- Changed the hard dependencies on the ADO.NET providers to be a reflection-based load, just like NHibernate.
- Changed the MySQL provider "RemoveForeignKey" method to call two SQL calls to the DB before the constraint would actually be deleted. This is the wierd piece, and I am not sure if it's just my OS or version of MySQL that needs this.
- Added a few more assertions to the provider unit tests just to be sure the expectations are being met.
- Changed the build file to handle different platforms, since the Npgsql driver is so platform-specific.
